# Runner

> The old Python runner is **deprecated** and no longer maintained.

This folder contains example configuration files used with my main project:
**[`dotctl`](https://github.com/maachue/dotctl)** - a lightweight and flexible
runner/static settings as files for dotfiles written in Rust.

The configs here demonstrate how to structure and use `.toml` task definitions
for different systems.

## Available Examples

- **CachyOS** - [`cachyos.toml`](./cachyos.toml)
  Example setup for a fresh CachyOS installation, including package installation
removals, flatpak installation, AUR, etc
